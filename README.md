# Sales-Insights

This project is under continuous updating...

### Introduction
MatCore Hardware is a company which supplies computer hardware and peripherals in India, where the headquarters is located in Delhi. The sales director, Alex, faces lots of challenges including tracking the market sales in this dynamically growing market. However, the information he has is only Excel files with massive numbers, which contain information related to transactions, customers, markets etc.. So, he approached the data analyst team with the requirements that he would like to know about the business insights in different marketing areas -- north, south and central India.

This project is to analyze the sales insight in different marketing zones, visualize the key information, and generate the report to support decision-making for the sales director in MatCore. The main tools utilized are Excel, SQL and Tableau.

### Data cleaning and wrangling
Firstly, I performed the data cleaning process to remove and fix inaccurate data with 4 main tasks.

Secondly, I performed the data wrangling process, to create new tables for hoc analysis. I also generated 3 performance metrics in this process.

Hoc analysis questions:

(1) Which marketing zone has the highest revenue?

(2) Which customers contribute to the highest revenue in different zones?

(3) What is the sales growth per quarter from 2017 to 2022? What about it in different zones?

(4) What is the average revenue per customer in different zones? What can you learn about related to customer behaviour?
